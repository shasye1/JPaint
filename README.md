# JPaint
A basic paint application in Java using MVC, design patterns, and UML diagrams.

I thought that this project was very useful and got me much more comfortable in using java and object-oriented programming in general. For successes, I’m glad that for the most part everything that was required works. Creating shapes, selecting them, moving them, etc. all works as it should. Design pattern-wise, I found them to be extremely useful. With that being said I think that there was a lot of things I could’ve improved on, such as the quality of my code and adhering to the SOLID principles.

Below are some UML diagrams regarding the design patterns used:
